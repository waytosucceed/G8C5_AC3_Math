Each shell they pick up seems to tell a mathematical tale â€” some adorned with intricate patterns and others plain and smooth. Shirley thought of teaching her children about prime numbers and composite numbers.

    As they gathered shells, Shirley pointed out those with symmetrical patterns (like prime numbers) and those with varied designs (like composite numbers), making their beach day a playful maths lesson. Alex and Jordan eagerly compared shells, finding beauty and mathematical wonder in each discovery, their curiosity sparked by the natural world around them.
